This "Hello Word" app is a second effort at learning the basics of the MEAN application stack.


_MEAN.io Revisited_

The first things that I concluded was that the stack provided by MEAN.io was too heavy for my taste; reminded me a bit of what I did not like about programming in stacks like WordPress.  That being said, seemed like a number of developers had adopted the naming convention and structure of MEAN.io app. So, I took my original Hello Mean app and restructued the flies for both the server and the client code.


_Mongoose_

The second improvement over "Hello Mean" was to switch out to using the Mongoose module for DB (Mongo) access from the more basic MongoDB module. Provided more or less the same features; but simpler and better handling of valication.

_Mobile Angular UI_

The last, and most visible, improvemnt was to layer in a mobile UI framework: Mobile Angular UI.  Before settling on Mobile Angular UI, I gave another popular UI framework for Angular, Ionic, a whirl but like MEAN.io, I found it too heavy for my taste.
